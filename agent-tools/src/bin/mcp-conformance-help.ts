export const HELP_TEXT = `Usage: pnpm -s mcp:conformance --target <url> [options]
(the -s keeps stdout pure JSON: without it, pnpm's own failure reporter
appends to stdout when a failing run exits 1)

Runs MCPJam conformance suites (lockfile-installed @mcpjam/cli) against a
deployed MCP surface. Two operations:

VERDICT (default): each suite is compared BY NAME against its committed
baseline — pass requires a usable baseline, retained raw evidence, no
duplicate check ids, zero unexpected failures, and the observed skip/fail
sets exactly matching the baseline. Baselines are validated UP FRONT: a
missing or unusable baseline fails the run immediately, with no network
contact, naming the --seed path.

SEED (--seed): capture-only. Runs the suites live, retains each raw
json-summary report verbatim (the observation seed for authoring
baselines), performs no comparison, and exits 0 iff every capture
succeeded. Without --unattended, the plan drives all three suites LIVE
against the target (the oauth leg is interactive), bounded at 120s/suite.

The wrapper's aggregate report goes to stdout AND <report-dir>/summary.json.

Examples (verdict, then seed):
  pnpm -s mcp:conformance --target https://mcp.example.test/mcp --unattended
  pnpm -s mcp:conformance --target https://mcp.example.test/mcp --unattended --seed

Options:
  --target <url>             MCP server URL (required), e.g. https://<host>/mcp
  --unattended               Headless credential-free plan (protocol + oauth DCR
                             discovery legs); forbids --credentials-file
  --seed                     Capture-only operation (no baseline verdicts)
  --suite <name>             protocol | apps | oauth (repeatable, no duplicates;
                             default: the mode's full plan)
  --credentials-file <path>  OAuth credentials file for authed suites
  --report-dir <path>        Raw-report dir, absolute or repo-root-relative
                             (default tmp/mcp-conformance/<utc-stamp>)
  --baseline-dir <path>      Baseline dir (default: the committed baselines)
  -h, --help                 Show this help
