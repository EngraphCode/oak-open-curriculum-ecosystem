 * directory is canonicalised BEFORE the potentially long universe scan, so an
 * ancestor replaced with a symlink between that canonicalisation and the
 * manifest write could redirect the temp-write/rename outside the repository.
 *
 * The out dir need not exist yet (the write phase creates it, per
 * `core/flag-path-resolve.ts`), so the baseline is captured from the NEAREST
 * EXISTING ANCESTOR of the out dir — the deepest path that can be canonicalised
 * before the scan. The write boundary re-canonicalises that same ancestor and
 * refuses on any drift from the baseline (an ancestor was swapped) or any
 * escape of the repository root; the absent trailing segments are then created
 * under the validated anchor. Every refusal returns `Err` before a single byte
 * is written.
