/**
 * The IO orchestration of `refound-window-sample`: read the ratified rule,
 * the S1 evidence, and the verified hits queue, drive the pure computation
 * over the composition root's {@link ByteSource}, and write the
 * `sweep/window-sample.v1.json` manifest. The leaf IO refusals live in
 * `refound-window-sample-io.ts`.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Refusals BEFORE anything is written: an unratified rule (acting on a
 * draft is the freeze's own posture), a live rule whose bytes differ from
 * the rule at the pinned base, an evidence file without the expected
 * machine-readable counts or digests, a `--base` disagreeing with the
 * evidence's `runBaseSha`, a hits queue whose bytes miss the recorded
 * SHA-256, a malformed hits row, every arithmetic halt inside the model,
 * and a symlinked write dir or manifest path. The write phase runs only
 * after every refusal has passed — nothing written on halt.
 *
 * The byte source arrives through the {@link ByteSourceFactory} seam so the
 * composition root (`refound-window-sample.ts` `main()`) owns the wiring:
 * the git-backed production source lives in `refound-window-sample-git.ts`;
 * integration tests inject in-memory sources and never spawn a process.
