/**
 * Aggregation for `agent-tools mcp-conformance` (MCP-189). Two named
 * operations, dispatched by `McpConformanceRunInput.operation`:
 *
 * VERDICT (default): every suite's baseline is resolved UP FRONT — a
 * missing or unusable baseline fails the whole run in milliseconds with no
 * network contact (fail-fast entry validation; the failure names the
 * `--seed` path). With baselines validated, each suite runs through the
 * spawn seam, retains its raw stdout VERBATIM before any parsing (a schema
 * rejection must never destroy the evidence), parses at the strict
 * boundary, and compares against its baseline.
 *
 * SEED (`--seed`): capture-only. Each suite runs and retains its raw
 * report — the observation seed for authoring baselines — with no
 * comparison; the operation passes iff every capture succeeded.
 *
 * Failure reasons are a LIST (never joined), so simultaneous problems all
 * surface. A failing, unlaunchable, or unparseable suite does not abort
 * the remaining suites, and the aggregate exit code is 0 iff every suite
 * verdict is `pass`. The per-suite pipelines live in `run-suite.ts`; the
 * IO ports in `io-port.ts`; outcome composition in `suite-outcome.ts`.
