/**
 * Build-time copy of the Oak Open Curriculum Design System's runtime files
 * into `public/`.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The app serves the design system as ordinary static assets under
 * `/oak-ds/`. The package is a devDependency consumed at build/dev/test
 * time only (precedent: `@oaknational/oak-design-tokens`), so nothing
 * design-system-shaped enters the deployed dependency graph — only the
 * copied files do.
 *
 * Two constraints shape the copy:
 *
 * - **Package-relative layout is mirrored.** `url()` resolution in CSS is
 *   relative to the stylesheet, so `fonts/` and `assets/icons/` must sit
 *   where `colors_and_type.css` and `oak-icons.css` expect them.
 * - **The set is declared, not globbed.** {@link OAK_DS_MANIFEST} is the
 *   contract; the integration suite recomputes the stylesheet's real
 *   `@import` + `url()` closure against it, so a design-system change that
 *   widens the closure fails the build rather than shipping a page with a
 *   missing font or icon.
 *
 * Deliberately excluded: `brand.css` (outside the `styles.css` closure —
 * it is the white-label override contract, not the Oak identity) and
 * `oak-flat.generated.css` (design-sync's derived artefact).
 *

 *
 * @remarks
 * A bare `rm` + multi-file copy leaves the destination absent or partial
 * for the whole copy window; a concurrently booting server (the boot

 * tree. Staging beside the destination and swapping via two `rename`
 * syscalls shrinks the absent window to the gap between them — POSIX
 * offers no true directory exchange, so this is the smallest window
 * available without a lock, small but NOT zero. Test suites never depend
 * on it: they read their own scratch roots via the `staticRoot` seam; the
 * residual window matters only to a hand-run server racing a hand-run
 * build.
