/**
 * Oak National Academy brand banner.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Displayed when `get-curriculum-model` fires as a session-start proxy.
 * The banner serves the human with orientation ("you are in Oak now").
 * The curriculum-model data serves the agent via text content; the human
 * sees only the brand banner.
 *
 * The wide wordmark is the design-system asset
 * (`@oaknational/oak-design-system/assets/logo-wide-black.svg`) imported
 * raw at build time, so the design system stays the single copy — there
 * is no second geometry to drift (MCP-368). The inner geometry is
 * injected into a JSX-owned `<svg>` root so the accessibility and
 * theming contract (aria-hidden, viewBox, class) lives in component
 * code; the slice drops the asset's XML prolog and root `id`. Colour
 * comes from CSS `fill: currentColor` on the logo class: the asset is
 * bare geometry with no fill attributes, inline fill styles, or style
 * elements, which the unit suite pins — a single upstream fill in any of
 * those forms would defeat inheritance and render the wordmark black in
 * every theme.
