# Guidance pipeline

## Goal

Guidance written by Oak's experts in plain English travels into the
app automatically: ingested on an explicit trigger, sanitised and
validated at a strict boundary, and served to assistants — with the
authors seeing exactly what will go live before it does. Once proven
with sample content, updating the app's guidance is a routine
re-ingest, never an engineering task: the engineering clock and the
expert-authoring clock are permanently separated.

## Mechanism

Owner-triggered ingest reads Ready-status rows from the authoring
space (never automatic — the authoring surface is not authoritative;
the ingested, reviewed artefact is). A strict schema validates at the
boundary: only the assistant-facing statement fields pass; provenance
(author, date, approver, template version) and a content hash travel
as metadata, so every ingest is auditably distinct and sign-off binds
to a specific version. A human-visible diff of exactly what will be
served precedes any production change. The served surface registers
through the visible-surface allowlist (the beneficial dependency:
integrable before that lane lands, registered through it once it has).

The minimum shippable shape without the allowlist lane: serve through
the existing registration path and migrate registration when the
allowlist lands.

## Acceptance criteria (each with a proof)

1. **Only Ready rows ingest, on an explicit trigger.** Proof
   (`repo-safe`): tests cover Draft/In-review rows refused, Ready rows
   accepted, and no ingest path that runs without the trigger.
2. **The boundary is strict.** Proof (`repo-safe`): red-first tests
   show non-conforming content (missing fields, unexpected structure,
   private-section leakage) rejected at the schema boundary with
   actionable errors.
3. **Provenance and content hash recorded per ingest.** Proof
   (`repo-safe`): the served artefact carries author, date, approver,
   template version, and hash; tests assert their presence and
   stability.
4. **The pre-live diff exists and gates serving.** Proof (`repo-safe`
   for the artefact's generation; `owner-held` for the review act):
   the diff artefact renders exactly what changes; the owner's
   confirming glance is recorded on the ticket before first
   production serve.
5. **End-to-end with sample content.** Proof (`repo-safe`): an
   integration test carries one sample document from authoring shape
   to served output; (`owner-held`): the owner confirms the sample's
   served form matches the authored intent.

## Todos

- Sliced at pickup by the implementer, each slice a single-story PR
  within its round budget (PDR-132).

## Out of scope

- The guidance content itself: authored by Oak's experts on their
  clock; this lane never blocks on it beyond the sample.
- The format/ingest-protocol decision: the named owner gate above —
  this lane implements the agreed protocol, it does not decide it.
- Serving-surface placement detail (app definition vs startup tool):
  confirmed with the owner at the protocol agreement.
