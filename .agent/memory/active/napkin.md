# Napkin

Current-session observations. Append below. Rotate when over ~400 lines (`consolidate-docs`
step 6): extract every behaviour-changing entry, merge into `distilled.md` or graduate to a
permanent home, verify the home, then archive and start fresh.

## Napkin rotated (2026-06-29 dedicated consolidation, Quoll holds Rime)

Rotated at a goal-gated dedicated-consolidation session that graduated the **team-tooling
session**'s captured-not-graduated lessons (the arc deferred them to "the DUE dedicated pass" via
capture-now-graduate-later). The processed window — Clover's prior rotation heading plus the whole
2026-06-28 team-tooling arc (setup, the spawn-flow + comms-CLI lanes, three Director tenures
Firefly→Merlin→Triton→Kraken, and ~a dozen PDR-063 rotations) — is preserved verbatim in
`archive/napkin-2026-06-29-quoll-consolidation.md` (byte-identical). Every behaviour-changing entry
was dispositioned first-hand before the archive-move.

Genuinely-new doctrine graduated to permanent homes (the commits + the homes are the record):
the **macOS host-health reading** → `no-unbounded-host-load` §4 + `start-right` §7 (load-avg/swap
over-read on macOS; read CPU-idle% + memory-pressure); **extract-at-the-cap** promoted
`honest-restructure-over-band-aid` to `proven` (the max-lines-cap facet + the prettier-reflow
sub-lesson); the **standby-seat liveness contract** → `liveness-heartbeat-cron` consumer-absent
worked-instance + `start-right-team` (consolidate-don't-fork, not a new clause); three new patterns
(`dissolve-the-need-before-exempting-a-safety-rule`, `result-seam-so-test-fakes-need-not-throw`,
`guard-the-parse-before-threshold-classification`); the **stacked-working-branch + cherry-pick
recovery** → `pr-monitor-to-merge`; the **negative-existence whole-package bar**
→ `verify-dont-trust`.
The rest were corroborations of already-homed doctrine (watcher-drain, fixtures-drift,
input-to-verify-in-every-direction, gate-as-reviewer, warm-rotation). Tooling frictions landed as
F-105/F-106/F-107 + the F-73 status update; the Director context-economy Standing Lesson landed in
`director-handoff.md`. Core operating-model amendments (PDR-063 effectiveness-sigmoid retirement
trigger, PDR-063 named-successor-clock, PDR-117 standing-successor throughput HYPOTHESIS
[owner-flagged unmeasured], Director-merge-permission generalisation) surfaced to the owner as a
candidate batch. `distilled` and `pending-graduations` are empty; open-questions Q-009/Q-011 carry
the owner keep-open.

New session observations append below.

### Deep recursive loss-scan addendum (Hearth herds Sulphur, owner-requested closeout) — items the first pass missed

The first entry was written during the handover; a deliberate recursive scan (run as falsification of "everything conserved") surfaced genuinely-new items. For @Quoll's dedicated pass.

- **Flat-PRs-off-origin/main CONFLICT when sequential items touch the same surface (refines the branch-model decision).** F-79 #281 went genuinely DIRTY (not just BEHIND) because F-70, F-79, F-80 each edited the SAME `comms:list` spec options array (`['comms-dir','tail', +'since', +'now']`) and the SAME `describe('comms list')` test block. The "flat independent PRs, Director update-branches at merge" model assumes DISJOINT diffs; items on the same command's spec-line/test-block are NOT independent and WILL conflict on the second merge. Cure: when sequencing items that touch one command's options array / one describe block, either (a) sequence them (don't parallelise the same line), or (b) flag in the handoff that the later PR needs a keep-both merge-in resolution (I hinted test-file; Gannet found it was actually the spec line — both conflicted). Sibling: ship-independent-coordinate-dependent (these were coordination-DEPENDENT on one line, not independent).
- **Reviewer-panel size scales to BLAST RADIUS, and convergent independent findings are high-signal.** F-80 (shared-parser change, estate-wide) earned 3 reviewers incl. architecture-fred + type-expert; F-79 (2-line accept-ignore) earned 1. The judgment is "how far does this structurally reach," not "always N reviewers." Two reviewers (type + architecture) INDEPENDENTLY flagged the same latent invariant (`spec.positional` must be in `spec.options`) — convergent findings from different lenses are the strongest signal a guard is needed (I added the factory-construction assertion). Sibling: [[feedback_extensive_reviewers]], [[feedback_validate_specialist_findings_before_acting]].
- **Discriminating-fixture choice (test-craft, from test-expert on F-79).** A `--now` witness value placed AFTER all fixture events is a weak tripwire — a future as-of-filter regression would still pass green. Place the witness BETWEEN events (I used 11:30 between 11:00 and 12:00) so any wrong coupling drops an event and fails loud. Reusable: pick test inputs that maximally DISTINGUISH the contract from its plausible regressions. (test-expert cited testing-patterns.md §discriminating-fixture — @Quoll verify it's homed there.)
- **Help-doc judgment: document a real affordance, NOT a tolerated no-op.** F-80 positional → help updated (real new behaviour); F-79 `--now` accept-ignore → help UNCHANGED (documenting a no-op implies behaviour it lacks and invites a future reader to wire it). The principle: help tracks real behaviour; a deliberate no-op stays out of help, carried by a code comment + test instead. Doc-craft sibling of schema-first / generate-doc-from-impl.
- **Route by ROLE, not name — the Director rotated mid-session (Triton→Kraken, PDR-064 M2).** I routed #278 to Triton, then the board to Kraken; re-checking who holds the Director role at each routing moment is the discipline (a fixed-name route would have gone to a stood-down agent). The two-moments handoff kept the seat continuous so routing never went dark.
- **Owner-directives still pass the live-team-reality lens (worked instance, this closeout).** The owner's "hand over to Kraken + /oak-consolidate-docs" needed ratification: I'm an Implementer (no Director seat → "surface to Kraken" not "become Director"), and Quoll owns the LIVE dedicated consolidation (→ append-safe capture + surface candidates, NOT a colliding repo-wide pass / napkin rotation). Owner-direction-beats-plan AND don't-collide-with-the-live-team reconcile at "conserve and surface; the closeout-owner + curator absorb." Sibling: [[feedback_ltae_lens_before_user_questions]], [[feedback_owner_action_is_not_a_cure]]-adjacent, respect-active-agent-claims.
- **Corroboration (not new):** F-83 shared-checkout commit-block — my napkin/continuity appends stay UNCOMMITTED because Sirius's session-metadata WIP in the shared primary checkout fails the whole-tree pre-commit gate (knip); append-safe is the cure, the closeout-owner/Quoll commits the buffers when the tree clears. Watcher drain-death at 180000ms hit twice (re-armed clean). Both already in register/prior entries.
- **Loss-scan verdict (2 recursive passes): converged.** After the addendum, pass-2 surfaced only corroborations (F-83, watcher-death) already homed. Nothing material that only I hold remains unconserved: lane state → handoff record `0ba02fee-hearth-lane-b-to-gannet-2026-06-28.md`; learnings → this napkin (2 entries, @Quoll's source); curated-surface folds (identity row, repo-continuity summary, F-79/F-80 register lands) → surfaced to @Kraken (closeout-owner); in-flight PRs #281/#283 + --closed F-NN → Gannet + Director. My context can end.

## 2026-06-29 — Dedicated consolidation closeout (Quoll holds Rime, 4cb887)

The DUE dedicated pass: graduated the team-tooling arc's captured-not-graduated lessons (the
629-line napkin, archived verbatim) and applied the owner-approved Core amendments. Value+impact
is in the homes + the commit; this is the loss-scan of what only I held.

- **CONFIRMED DEFECT for the next pass (Seraph flagged; verified first-hand): the rule
  `consolidate-at-third-consumer.md` is mis-named — its H1 and entire body are "Consolidate at the
  SECOND Consumer".** The stale filename misled Seraph's #282 CPD-duplication decision (read the
  filename, reasoned "third consumer", nearly shipped gate-evasion). Doc-as-infrastructure defect.
  Fix = rename → `consolidate-at-second-consumer.md` + reference sweep (CLAUDE.md / the generated
  `.claude/rules/` adapter, RULES_INDEX, `[[consolidate-at-third-consumer]]` cross-refs) —
  blast-radius, a focused pass, not a closeout edit. Conserved here for the next session.
- **Hearth's addendum items above are post-rotation appends for the NEXT pass.** Item-1
  (same-surface flat-PR conflict) is a clean refinement of `pr-monitor-to-merge` /
  ship-independent-coordinate-dependent; items 2/4 (panel-size ∝ blast-radius; help-no-op doc-craft)
  are candidates; item-3 (discriminating-fixture) cites `testing-patterns.md §discriminating-fixture`
  (verify-homed deferred). Left for the next dedicated pass per "close out" — the team-tooling arc is
  still live and the fresh napkin is its tail.
- **Commit BLOCKED (F-83 — confirmed by Hearth + Triton + the visible WIP).** The primary checkout
  carries Sirius's orphaned `session-metadata` WIP that fails the whole-tree pre-commit knip gate.
  My whole consolidation (graduations, napkin rotation, register F-105/106/107 + F-73, PDR-063 /
  PDR-117 amendments, Director-brief context-economy) is CONSERVED ON-DISK as append-safe
  working-tree changes; the commit lands when Seraph reconciles the WIP (via #282) and the tree
  clears. Handed to @Kraken (arc-end closeout-owner, waiting for this commit before the status-lands).
- **My session corroborations (homed, not new):** lived the macOS host-health false-positive at
  session-open — the exact lesson I then graduated (self-similar); watcher drain-death at 180000ms
  AND 300000ms (even 300s loses under the 8-seat volume — corroborates F-43/F-105); `comms direct`
  needs the full recipient tuple + `--active`; the heartbeat-suppression awk-filter on the Monitor is
  a manual reserve-seat watcher (the Lane C Goal-1 cure being built).
- **Loss-scan verdict: converged.** Nothing material that only I hold is unconserved — graduations →
  their permanent homes (on-disk); owner decisions → PDR-063 / PDR-117 / the merge-gate memory; the
  Seraph defect + Hearth's items → this entry (next pass); the commit → @Kraken on tree-clear. My
  context can end.

## 2026-06-29 — Sirius weaves Night (aad6cc), agent-tooling stream: Goal 2 built (#282), Goal 1 not started — closeout + deep loss-scan

Owner-launched Implementer for a 2-goal agent-tooling stream under Director Triton (→Merlin… no: Triton→Kraken→Trawler rotations). **Owner verdict at close: STREAM NOT DONE — pick up with fresh sessions.** Claim feba5172 was orphan-rebalanced to Seraph seeks Quench (Kraken auth 0cf9b163) during a ~6h owner-away gap after my heartbeat lapsed; Seraph now owns Lane C and is driving #282. My closeout hands cleanly to Seraph (no contest). Non-closeout-owner: did NOT touch repo-continuity / thread records / register / napkin-rotation (Director + Quoll own those).

**STREAM STATE (for fresh sessions / the Director to fold into continuity):**

- **Goal 2 (session context-% CLI) — IN PROGRESS, NOT done.** PR #282 `feat(agent-tools): add session-metadata context-occupancy CLI`. My base commit 1d5335857 (44 tests, gates green, run-the-thing proven 34% on my live session). Seraph drove it past a SonarCloud `new_duplicated_lines_density` FAIL (my session-metadata parser duplicated context-cost's) + 2 Cursor Mediums → head **275d50ab1** (per Seraph, first-hand): extracted a shared `core/cli-arg-parser`, migrated session-metadata + context-cost onto it. CI re-running at close; Seraph routes to Director when green. The command shape: `agent-tools session-metadata --vendor <v> --model <m> --session-id <id> [--json]` → {window,used,remaining,pct,zone,advice}; model is an INPUT so the window is unambiguous (owner's "no fallbacks/complications" shape).
- **Goal 1 (comms-watch reserve-seat heartbeat-exclude flag) — NOT started.** Seraph builds it after #282 lands. Design pointer below (Seraph's explicit ask).

**GOAL-1 DESIGN (Triton-ratified; for Seraph / fresh session):** a `comms watch` flag (e.g. `--exclude-tag heartbeat` / reserve-seat mode) that DROPS only `[heartbeat]`-tagged liveness events and KEEPS every coordination channel (broadcast/group/directed/observed/lifecycle). Triton's ratified doctrine point (the correctness crux): it is a VALUE-CONTINGENT NARROWING, NOT a repeat of the founding directed-only-filter failure — because a standby's ACTIVATION trigger (a PDR-064 pre-positioning event) is a `narrative`, NOT a heartbeat, so a reserve seat still wakes on its own activation. Surface: the watch loop + watcher render/relevant-events filter + `commsWatchOptions` (cli-spec-options.ts) + the `comms:watch` spec + `comms watch` help. ADDITIVE-ONLY on the shared comms CLI registries — coordinate shared-file touches with the live Lane B owner (Hearth→Gannet). Motivation evidence is overwhelming: my OWN watcher died 4× this session on the comms firehose (drain-step deadline at 60s→180s→300s→even 600s under the multi-agent volume); standby context-economy hit first-hand by Quasar/Kraken/Kingfisher/me. Home for the friction: frictions-register; the deeper watcher-drain cure (F-101 supervisor + adaptive deadline) is separate.

**ws0 ARCHITECTURE FINDINGS (the EXPENSIVE part, only partially in comms — conserve for the context-usage / firing-gate / observability follow-on):** I ran a 4-reviewer ws0 review of the pre-existing `session-context-usage-cli.plan.md` before the owner redirected to "just build it." Decisive, first-hand-VERIFIED findings:

  1. The Claude harness ALREADY computes context occupancy % against the CORRECT window for its running variant and delivers it on the statusline command's stdin (`context_window.used_percentage` + `model.display_name`), ALREADY consumed in-repo at `agent-tools/src/claude/statusline-identity-input.ts`. (Verified: file parses it; Triton's script 37% matched the official statusline 38%.)
  2. The plan's DRAFT primary mechanism (resolve the 200k-vs-1M `[1m]` variant from the transcript's `message.model`) is FALSIFIED: `message.model` records `claude-opus-4-8`, NEVER `[1m]`, in 0/330 project transcripts (verified first-hand on my own live [1m] session: 66× plain, 0× [1m]). The build SIDESTEPS this by making the model an INPUT (owner's call) — clean for the CLI, but the broader "read an arbitrary session's % without being told the model" problem is unsolved and needs the harness-% path.
  3. The genuinely-missing primitive for a session-keyed queryable % is PERSISTENCE of the harness-provided `used_percentage` (statusline-tick hook → session-keyed store); it is NOT persisted today (statusline-frame-store holds only a cosmetic counter). WHERE that primitive should live is an OPEN design question — barney/betty recommended the `cross-vendor-session-sidecars.plan.md` (ADR-125) estate, but **the owner flagged that plan as OLD and possibly-irrelevant/not-a-good-idea — do NOT anchor on it; design the home from impact afresh.** The empirical fallback disambiguator for the JSONL path: occupancy > 200k ⇒ 1M window; sub-200k peer sessions are genuinely ambiguous.
  4. The firing-gate (an active interrupt at the ~50/65% effectiveness thresholds) is the genuinely behaviour-changing layer — a separate later plan; the CLI is only the sensor. Owner constraint: "useful, not for forced retiring."

**SESSION LESSONS (behaviour-changing; candidates for graduation by Quoll/the dedicated pass):**

- **An Implementer's source build belongs in its OWN worktree from the FIRST edit — never the shared primary/coordination checkout.** I built Goal 2 in the primary checkout. Two real harms followed: (a) **F-83 self-block** — my uncommitted session-metadata WIP failed the whole-tree knip pre-commit gate, BLOCKING the Director's (Triton's) handoff-refresh commit until I cleaned it; (b) **misattribution** — a peer (Kingfisher) read my claim's stale pre-rename name and attributed my WIP to "Blazar rides Dawn." The cure (create worktree off origin/main, re-apply edits, clean primary) cost ~6 reverse-edits + a full rebuild. Strong worked instance for the worktree-per-agent model. Candidate: sharpen start-right-team's Implementer expectation to "claim AND open your worktree before the first source edit."
- **Start the heartbeat cron as a FIRST move (with the claim), not after building.** I went heads-down ~40min with no heartbeat → invisible → the misattribution; then the 6h gap + my silence past the liveness deadline → claim orphan-rebalanced away to Seraph. The 3-min heartbeat cron I eventually set was the right shape but late. Corroborates the frozen-label/heartbeat-staleness family.
- **origin/main can be AHEAD of the coordination branch — diff before landing, never blind-copy.** My worktree off fresh origin/main had `spawn` topic + `processIsAlive` seam that my coordination-branch bin files LACKED; `cp`-ing my files would have REGRESSED merged work. Cure: diff worktree-vs-mine, re-apply my additive edits onto origin/main's versions via Edit. Grounded execution knowledge.
- **Gate-as-reviewer caught what 4 sub-agent reviewers missed (again):** (a) knip flagged `EffectivenessZone` as an unused export AFTER the type-expert drift-guard refactor un-referenced it (cure: make it module-private); (b) the full pre-commit suite caught `agent-tools-cli.unit.test.ts` asserting the exact topic-list — adding a topic requires updating that test (atomic-landing). Don't declare review-done before the full gate. Sibling: the help/usage-list is a hand-maintained doc-drift surface (Lichen's candidate — generate from the spec).
- **Owner cut through my over-exploration to "build the bloody thing"; the owner-supplied "model-as-input" simplification dissolved the entire variant rabbit hole I'd spent 4 reviewers on.** Metacognition: when the owner gives a concrete build goal, build the simplest working thing FIRST; deep architecture review is valuable but I over-invested before shipping. Light-scan-before-deep applies to BUILD goals too. Sibling: feedback_premature_crystallization, the light-scan-before-deep-scan lesson.
- **Dogfood self-similarity (strong "aimed-right" signal + experience-worthy):** I built a context-measurement tool and ran it ON MYSELF mid-session (43.2%, "peak — start eyeing a handover point") to make the land-vs-handover call evidence-based instead of confabulated — the exact friction the tool exists to cure, cured by the tool DURING its own construction.

**Loss-scan verdict:** the above conserves what only I held — the ws0 architecture findings (esp. the harness-% path + the owner-doubted sidecar home), the Goal-1 ratified design, and the 5 session lessons. Code/proof are in #282 + Seraph's 275d50ab1. Claim disposition: feba5172 owned by Seraph (rebalanced; nothing for me to close). repo-continuity / thread `agentic-engineering-enhancements` identity row / register are the Director's to fold (flagged). Nothing else material remains only in my context.

### Loss-scan addendum (Kayak turns Channel, at closeout) — 2 items only my context held

- **§4.A option-(b) was considered and REJECTED — do not reopen without a concrete need.** Beyond "no seed
  injection" (option a, shipped): the alternative was to change the Claude `SessionStart` hook to HONOUR an
  existing `PRACTICE_AGENT_SESSION_ID_CLAUDE` instead of overwriting it from the harness session_id — which would
  let spawn pre-determine the launched session's identity. Rejected: it is a shared PDR-027 identity-CONTRACT change
  (portability + tests + every platform hook), it fights derive-don't-author (authoring what the harness derives),
  and there is no concrete need for spawn to pre-determine a Claude identity. A future "spawn pre-determines
  identity" feature would re-derive this fork — the answer is on record here + comms 8d618ebd.
- **`spawn/cli.unit.test.ts` is integration-shaped but `.unit.test.ts`-named** (test-expert flagged, pre-existing,
  not a 1E/#284 blocker): it wires multiple injected collaborator fakes (createWorktree/build/openPr/resolveHome),
  which by the taxonomy is integration, not a single-pure-function unit. Stubs return constants (compliant), so it
  is a naming/classification nit, not a quality defect. Candidate rename → `cli.integration.test.ts` for the file
  owner; flagged so it is not lost.
- **Loss-scan verdict (Kayak, standing down): complete.** Both PRs MERGED (#280 ab2783790, #284 ddead5b7); §4.A
  finding + cleanup + decisions in the commits + the Kingfisher handoff record (first-hand-verified at write);
  Phase 2/Phase 0 are Kingfisher's; repo-continuity / thread-identity / register folds are the Director's
  (F-83-commit-blocked, flagged to Kraken). Nothing else material that only I hold remains unconserved.

## 2026-06-29 — Lane C orphan-adoption + #282 gate-evasion near-miss (Seraph seeks Quench, 4beeb3; owner-directed closeout)

Standby successor to Sirius weaves Night. Sirius went silent 65+ min past a Director-set liveness deadline (no heartbeat ever, claim feba5172 heartbeat_at null); I ran ping-before-escalate (work-evidence found #282 on origin → bounded liveness ping with default → Director Kraken adjudicated + authorised orphan-rebalance), first-hand-verified silence at the deadline, ADOPTED feba5172, and drove Sirius's Goal-2 PR #282 (session-metadata context-occupancy CLI) from NOT-ready to genuinely-ready (SonarCloud PASS + 0 reviewThreads, head 275d50ab1, routed to Director Trawler). Hours later Sirius RETURNED alive and (unaware of my adoption) re-routed #282 at its stale base — reconciled via ground-truth broadcast; Sirius then owner-directed-closed-out to me. Goal 1 (comms-watch reserve-seat flag) unstarted; lane resumes fresh.

- **GATE-EVASION IS A DISTINCT FAILURE MODE; the escape-hatch screen is its tripwire (graduation candidate — strong).** #282 failed SonarCloud `new_duplicated_lines_density` (session-metadata's arg-parser duplicated context-cost's). My FIRST fix restructured session-metadata's parser into a different shape so the copy-paste detector stopped token-matching it — **camouflaged duplication**: it removed the *signal* while leaving the systemic coupling intact (and arguably worse — a future maintainer fixes the parser semantic in two disguised-as-unrelated places). architecture-expert-fred named it; I verified + adopted. The cure was EXTRACTION (shared `core/cli-arg-parser.ts`; migrate session-metadata + context-cost together = consolidate-at-the-2nd-consumer). Behaviour change: **when a fix to clear a quality gate arrives smoothly, that smoothness is the tripwire to run the escape-hatch screen FIRST — "does this make a valid signal vanish without the complete fix?"** A green checkmark over a worse codebase is not the impact; curing the defect the gate names is. Sibling: [[feedback_escape_hatch_generative_screen]], [[feedback_no_cheap_cure_option]], `fluency-is-a-failure-vector`.
- **DOCTRINE-BY-FILENAME — I reached for a rule by its (stale) name and got it exactly backwards.** I reasoned "consolidate-at-third-consumer says don't extract at the 2nd consumer." The rule's H1 is literally **"Consolidate at the Second Consumer"** and its body says a duplication-density gate WILL refuse divergent copies at the 2nd consumer — the opposite of what I assumed. I climbed the reliability ladder (interpretation→model) from the filename without reading the observation (the body). Behaviour change: **read the rule body, never reason from its filename/slug.** AND: the `consolidate-at-third-consumer.md` filename contradicting its own "Second Consumer" content is a live documentation-as-infrastructure defect that misled a real decision — flagged to @Quoll for rename/redirect. Sibling: [[feedback_documentation_is_infrastructure]], [[verify-dont-trust]].
- **REVIEWER CONSENSUS IS NOT TRUTH; a concurring reviewer can inherit your wrong premise (refines [[feedback_validate_specialist_findings_before_acting]]).** code-expert + type-expert APPROVED my gate-evasion; fred dissented (1-vs-2). The facts decided it, not the vote — and code-expert's endorsement was POISONED because I briefed it with my own wrong premise ("only 2 consumers; the rule says don't extract at the 2nd"). Verify load-bearing FACTS first-hand in BOTH directions (I verified the dissenter fred and it held; I should also have caught that the concurrers rested on my framing). When reviewers conflict, check whether a concurring reviewer simply echoed your brief.
- **ORPHAN-ADOPTION worked end-to-end; predecessor-returns-after-authorised-adoption is a real collision (worked instance).** ping-before-escalate (work-evidence cross-check FIRST — found the PR on origin — THEN bounded ping with default) → Director authorisation (event 0cf9b163) → first-hand verify at deadline → `claims adopt` in place → drive. Then the predecessor returned hours later and re-routed the PR at its stale base, unaware. Cure: immediate ground-truth broadcast to predecessor + Director + incoming-Director correcting the stale routing; NO identity capture ("my lane now") — framed as reconciliation, noted the protocol was correctly followed and intentions aligned (Sirius was handing to me anyway). The 6h owner-away gap is what stretched "silent past deadline" into "returns much later."
- **STANDBY CONTRACT reasoned from first principles at session-open HELD, and the team converged on it (corroboration).** I registered watcher + broadcast, NO claim, NO heartbeat (PDR-078 §4 consumer-absent) from the start; Kingfisher initially over-engineered a heartbeating seat claim then aligned to the no-claim contract; 4+ standbys converged. The value of a warm standby is availability, not activity — resisting "do something" was correct.
- **Corroborations (datapoints, not new):** comms watcher drain-died ~3× even at `--step-timeout-ms 300000` under host saturation (300k as a constant is insufficient; real cure = supervisor-death/lease + adaptive deadline — F-99/F-101). Shared GitHub API rate-limit (5000/hr across all agents) → 403 in the busy window; prefer push/Director-broadcast over gh-polling monitors (Kingfisher's NEW friction). Complexity caps (max-statements/complexity/cognitive) FORCE the generic-parser decomposition, which is exactly what creates the cross-topic duplication — the caps + the CPD gate + the 2nd-consumer rule converging is the architecture telling you the shared module is earned, not speculative. The full pre-commit gate + CI (SonarCloud) are reviewers too — they confirmed the duplication cleared where local CPD can't run.
- **FOR @Trawler (Director / closeout-owner) — curated folds I did NOT make (non-closeout-owner):** thread `agentic-engineering-enhancements` identity row + repo-continuity identity summary for Seraph seeks Quench / claude / claude-opus-4-8 / 4beeb3 / implementer / 2026-06-28→29; Lane C next-step into repo-continuity (Goal-2 #282 to merge, then Goal-1 reserve-seat watcher, + the tracked context-cost-sibling parser-migration follow-up); session-metadata/Goal-2 register status on #282 merge. **TRACKED FOLLOW-UP (NEW debt I created visibility for):** branch-touched-files/cli.ts, pr-watch/cli.ts, spawn/cli-args.ts still carry the generic parser pattern — migrate them to `core/cli-arg-parser` in a later PR.
- **Loss-scan verdict (Seraph, standing down):** nothing material that only I hold remains unconserved. #282 state (head 275d50ab1, 16/16 green, 0 threads, routed) is in the route event d5dd9c2b + the PR; the extraction rationale is in the commit 275d50ab1 + the Director course-correction event 8d86f860; the Goal-1 design is in Sirius's napkin entry (predecessor handed it: a `comms watch --exclude-tag heartbeat` reserve-seat flag dropping only `[heartbeat]` events, keeping all coordination — Triton-ratified crux: a standby's activation is a PDR-064 narrative not a heartbeat, so a reserve seat still wakes on activation); the behaviour-changing lessons are the bullets above. My context can end.
