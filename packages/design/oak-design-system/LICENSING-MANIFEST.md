# Licensing manifest — initial integration (ADR-213 §1)

Per-file-class dispositions for the design system's initial import from the
Claude Design studio (project "Oak Open Curriculum Design System", v1.7.0).
This manifest is the owner's licensing review surface: every class the studio
holds is listed with provenance, licence, and disposition. Held-out classes
are explicitly gitignored at the workspace root; since the 2026-07-24 owner
ruling ("Commit all 39") their byte-preserved copies are committed in the
MCP-137 capture tier, which is the re-obtain path (the studio remains the
original source).

The system's own gate clause, verbatim (its `LICENCES.md` §"Oak marks (not
open-licensed)"):

> The Oak logo, the official icon set (`assets/icons/`), brand imagery in
> `uploads/`, and the Oak name are Oak National Academy brand assets —
> excluded from any open licence on this project's code, mirroring the
> ecosystem repo's `BRANDING.md`. […] making this system a tracked open
> package is gated on explicit licensing of these marks (DECISIONS "Ecosystem
> convergence").

**Owner ruling (2026-07-19, discharging the marks gate)**: "any Oak material
in OCE will automatically have the correct license, as long as brand assets
are kept separate and their licence file references BRANDING.md." Both
conditions hold here: brand assets live in the bounded `assets/` class and
[LICENCES.md](LICENCES.md) references [BRANDING.md](../../../BRANDING.md)
directly. The Oak-material owner-call flags below are therefore RESOLVED:
track. The hub's tracked `oak-logo*.svg` baseline is ratified by the same
ruling. Class 14a (third-party social marks) sits OUTSIDE the ruling — not
Oak material — and remains tracked-for-referential-use with its LICENCES.md
rows on the studio sync-back list.

The gate bound the **marks**, not the code: everything MIT/OFL below always
proceeded; the marks classes were the owner call, now ruled. Repo baseline for that call: this is
Oak's own repository, `BRANDING.md` already excludes Oak marks from the MIT
licence repo-wide, and the hub demo already **tracks** `public/oak-logo*.svg`
under exactly that posture (ratify or correct as part of this review).

## Structural boundary (owner ruling, 2026-07-19)

Quality-gate exemptions are legitimate "if and only if" the material is not
used as production code AND is kept explicitly as Claude Design source
material. The non-production classes below (specimens, proofs, reference
build, templates, reference components, reveal.js integration, proof pages)
therefore live under [`studio-source/`](studio-source/README.md) — the
structural boundary the Sonar/knip/depcruise scopes bind to. Class rows keep
their studio-relative names; in-repo they resolve under `studio-source/`.
`brand.css` is on the package export surface — product code — and is fully
analysed.

The studio's `CLAUDE-CODE-HANDOFF.md` also carries a "do NOT ship" list
(specimens, proofs, ui_kits, templates). That list is **consumer-fencing** —
what goes into a consuming app — written under the pre-integration hand-off
frame. Under ADR-213 those classes are part of the system and live here (they
are its validation instruments and fidelity targets); the package `exports`
map is what fences consumers.

## Referential-integrity condition (ADR-213 §1)

No tracked file may reference a held-out file **on the repo-consumable public
surface** (the CSS entry points, tokens, and docs) — verified clean (prose
mentions only). Known, documented exception: studio-runtime wiring — the four
component specimen cards, `templates/*/ds-base.js`, and the standalone deck
load the studio's compiled `_ds_bundle.js`; that wiring renders live on the
studio surface only and is recorded in the workspace README. With the
recommended dispositions (marks tracked), classes 15–16 are the only holdouts
— at the workspace root; their capture-tier copies are committed records
(2026-07-24 ruling), which narrows this condition without weakening it.
If the owner holds out class 13/14 instead, the import must apply the
gitignored-local-assets pattern (tracked code + gitignored `assets/` + a
documented re-obtain runbook) before landing.
